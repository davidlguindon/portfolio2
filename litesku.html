            My plan for this project was to use Guerilla Tactics for sense-checking and usability testing.<br>
            However, the COVID-19 pandemic hit shortly after the project was started.<br>
            <!-- I was looking forward to talking with small business owners so...<br><br> -->
            I decided to narrow the project scope, and focus less on polishing the UX, and adding features for the time being.

          <h1>Understanding a <br>Design's Environment</h1>
          <small>By David Guindon</small>
          <article>
            <p class='subhead'>
              I started the LiteSku project because I noticed that even the better-designed inventory management systems still miss the mark when it comes to a genuinely polished UX design.
            </p>
            <p>
              The better systems offer all the essential tools, with excellent organization. They are easy to understand and integrate well with other software. What more could you want from an app?
            </p>
            <p>
              Their designs overlook tiny but vital details in the flow of tasks. These small problems often compound into enormous amounts of wasted time when you consider 500 stores repeating these same actions every fifteen minutes in each
              department.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is an example of an important feature that is often overlooked in systems like this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us say you are doing a task on the sales floor. You bring up your inventory tool and go through the menus to find the feature you need. Since it is a common task, it only takes ten seconds. You work on the project for about two
              minutes and see a customer who requires help.
              This interaction is crucial for a retail store and extremely common. It happens dozens of times a day, and the employee should be the one initiating the exchange. Being approachable when on the sales floor is more important than a task,
              and the computer in your hand should be able to assist the customer quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Situations like this are where significant UX problems start showing up in many designs. When the employee encounters this situation, it is often frustrating for the employee. They want to give the customer their full attention.
              However, they need 10 - 30 seconds to get their app into the appropriate menu to answer the customer’s question. Also, switching menus for the customer means losing their previous work in many apps.
              What tends to happen is that instead of giving a great experience to the customer, the employee abandons their device and provides the customer with generalized information or fewer options. It is not because an employee is lazy, but
              because the app gives the employee a bad user experience by being slow at swapping tasks and not saving progress. Using the app as intended is not realistic because of its UX design. If an employee loses one to three minutes while
              giving proper customer service, many days, not even half of their required tasks can be realistically completed.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the example mentioned, employees are repeatedly given a no-win situation, creating a bad experience for the employee and a bad experience for each customer interacting with the employee while using the software.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is staggering when you think about how significant an impact fixing a problem in an inventory management app can have on a chain of stores. It shows why UX design is so important. However, finding UX problems like this using
              traditional research techniques can be challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
              An interface that only crudely understands a persona’s environment, and has collected all their data from the lab, or from talking with users may still be missing some of the most critical holistic factors in the UX.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if you talk to an employee with this problem, it is unlikely that they will notice making a subconscious decision when interacting with customers and will not bring it up during testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think the best way to catch problems like this early is to have UX designers observe the environment their personas are operating in, shadowing and talking with users of all skill levels, and performing the actions themselves. A good
              UX designer is more sensitive to the big picture needs of a user and can provide invaluable information early in the design process.
