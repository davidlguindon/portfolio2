    <h1>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>I started out going to college for civil engineering, got to my senior year and realized that engineering was not for me.  While I enjoyed the problem solving and math, it did not have as much design as I wanted.  So I swapped to Architectural design, and loved it, however, long story short, I could not afford to continue taking classes at my graduate school.  I decided to pivot to UX design.  When I was in high school I did alot of UX design for a videogame me my best friend and I made, and absolutely loved it.  I spent more time repeatedly resketching the interfaces and user flows for the game in class, than I did listening to the teacher.  I considered getting into programing after high school but thought fixing code all day was not the way I wanted to go.  Twenty years of working retail later it does not sound so bad!  I really should have looked into UX design earlier in my life, but honestly the thought never crossed my mind that people will actually pay you build interfaces and ask people feedback about them! That is just too good to be true.</p>
