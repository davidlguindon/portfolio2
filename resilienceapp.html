          <h1>The Power Of Communication</h1>
          <small>By David Guindon</small>
          <article>
            <p class='subhead'>
              One day, I decided to do some volunteer design work to help the COVID-19 effort. After I got access to all the required files and channels, I jumped right in. When I came on board the project, most of the initial planning had been done.
              There was an excellent set of Style Guides, UI Components, User Flows, and Personas! Other designers had already spent about a week coming up with ideas and wireframes. I spent the next two days looking over the non-wireframe
              Information
              Architecture. I also attended a few designer meetings to get a better feel for what was going on. Now I was ready to start knocking out kanban cards!
            </p>
            <p>About 50 kanban cards were marked for designers at this point, and around 15 of them were marked as completed. "Not a bad start," I thought. I picked a card that sounded fun and opened up the Figma file. There were at LEAST 500 frames
              in
              there, and on initial inspection, they were in no particular order. "Oh man!" I thought, "this one might be tough. It looks like an army of designers all sprinted to a wall and started writing wherever there was space!" Creating any new
              ideations at this point would just be making the mess bigger. I spent the next two days looking over what had already been created and mentally sorting out what frames went with what kanban card and what screens could be effectively
              linked.
            </p>
            <p>After looking everything over, I noticed that a kanban card could have up to five solutions, all by different designers, whose names did not appear under the designer tab. However, nearly all the solutions were effective in the context
              of
              the kanban card.
            </p>
            <p>This is what I think was happening. When the project was fresh, several designers joined each day. They read the onboarding instructions, looked over the provided information architecture, picked a kanban card, then wireframed a
              solution.
              However, they were too nervous to move kanban cards to the next phase. After a day or two, they would get overwhelmed and quit the project. What an interesting problem!
            </p>
            <p>After a few more days and three long meetings, we ended up hashing out a vague path through all the content to make a viable initial MVP. Now that things settled
              down a bit, we were down to approximately 25 kanban cards without solutions. I grabbed a few that all dealt with roughly the same task, and went to work. I let the other designers who had been on the project longer polish up the designs
              we
              decided to use. I frequently used Figma's comment tool to share ideas and concerns about the unpolished cards, or the cards that someone else was editing.
            </p>
            <p>After completing the cards I was working on, I started polishing the designs adjacent to what I had sent to the developers. That way, when someone had a question about that section, they would know whom to ask. After chatting with the
              devs
              for a while and watching my designs become a reality, the initial MVP shipped. It was a fun journey filled with amazing people from every time zone. The team's ability to talk out potential problems and mold a huge set of puzzle pieces
              into
              a cohesive story with so many hands in the design pie was a great experience. Soon after this, the next project came knocking, and I headed out.

              <!-- <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Motivations: </span>Frank is a student and still living at home by himself. His college life keeps him busy, but he also spends a large amount of his time playing video games and secretly aspires to be a
            professional video game player. Because of this Frank spends nearly as much time playing video games as he does on his college life. Frank’s parents give him a monthly allowance to live on so most of his budget goes to his hobby. Frank
            is very familiar with technology and would feel comfortable using any sort of device.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Working on ResilienceApp was an enlightening experience. However, I was unable to focus on making and testing my designs, which was disappointing. We had a team of 20+ designers that dropped down to about five. No leadership with the final say, coupled with user stories being broad and vague. This environment created many repeated features and conflicting design flows.  However, design is not all about mockups and research. It is about solving problems.  You never know what you are getting into when onboarding into a new project.  Getting across the finish line always feels good.
