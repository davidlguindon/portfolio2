  <div class="problem"><h1>Problem</h1><h3>Black Desert Online has an economic system that has very low profit margins on elastic goods, this leads to it being difficult to know what to produce as a new user.  To compound this problem, when someone does find a profitable item to produce, they do not share it, because the market can not handle many users producing the same good.</h3></div>
  <div class="solution"><h1>Solution</h1><h3>Desert Paradigm allows users to imput their personal data into a spreadsheet and find the most profitable item for them to create given the current market. This can be done even though their is no public API available This is because users are able to audit out of date items and update their information, then share it with other users.</h3></div>

      <h1>Discovery and Research</h1><h3><br> Since I was my own client for this project, my first step was to research what other options were available in the marketplace currently.  After looking over what competitors in the market had to offer I created four competitive analysis for what were objectively the strongest contenders.<br><br>
        Using what I learned from the competitive analysis I created a survey to find what features and monetization plans would resonate the best with the game’s community.<br><br>
        After getting the results from the survey, I compiled my findings into a report, and then created two user personas that best fit the demographics I found.

        <h1>Information Architecture</h1><h3>Creating the user story for this project was actually quite easy, because of all the pre work I had done earlier.  I already had a long list of possible features I wanted to add, and assigned importance ratings to the features based on what the users said they wanted.  The basic navigation, login, and other admin commands were also included in the mvp.<br><br>
          After creating the mvp for the project, I started working on user flows, a site map, and a content strategy.  Thankfully this time the user flows were relatively basic, and did not need much tweaking after the initial design.<br><br>
          After finishing the pre-work for the information architecture step, I started on a set of wireframes, including a landing page.  I also made a prototype at this time and got some initial feedback from co-workers and conducted three usability tests.  The test script and test notes are provided in the deliverables folder.

            <h1>Visual Design</h1><h3>

              The visual design process started out with me sketching some things out on paper, and putting in writing what I wanted the brand characteristics to be.  After a sufficient ammount of
              sketches and ideas had built up, I transitioned to the computer and started to further refine and eliminate ideas.<br><br>

              To create a color pallet and typography, I started with creating a moodboard that fit the criteria of my brand characteristics, and let the ideas from the mood board bleed over into the creation of a color palette and typography for the style guide.<br><br>

              After creating a style guide I started building the high fidelity mockups and prototype.  I also performed additional usability testing in this phase.  The feedback from these mockups and the prototype was easily the most informative I had in the project, and went through many iterations before I was happy with the feedback I was getting.<br><br>

From these usability tests I created several options for what the final design could be.   This is where I did the most preference tests to really nail down what the average user would like the most from a set of multiple polished designs.

                <!-- <h1>Hidden Bonus Reflection</h1><h3>This project was an exercise for me to learn and solidify my design process, it was created for myself and I was not planning on using it for a portfolio piece, so the audience of many of my documents are not what I would have liked.  While designing it I made it in a way that I could complete the whole project on my own and would like to finish and publish the site in my spare time.  My two largest regrets on the project as it stands currently are that I did not design the site to have full functionality on mobile, roughly half of the features are cut out, and if I was going to do it again I would design mobile first.  The reason I did not is because the game the site is intended for high end gaming computers. Not having the full functionality on mobile still bothers me because with better planning I could have incorporated it easily.  My second regret is that I have yet to find a way to show item data in a way that all my testers easily understood.  Each iteration was getting better, but I decided to end the project before everything was ironed out to my satisfaction. In my last trial I did not even take the time to test the contrast ratio of my new color coded design.  Overall I had a very fun time building this project, and would appreciate it if someone who is looking at it keeps in mind that I was focused on speed and learning the design process more than fine tuning and making a project I would actually send to a client.</h3> -->
                <h1>Reflection</h1><h3>
                  The most difficult part of this task was creating a form that would easily allow cross referencing items and creation methods.  There are hundreds of variables to consider when trying to figure out the best item to create, and we had to figure out a way to organize them in a way that would make sense to the user, and programmers alike. We also had to try to minimize the amount of user input by auto filling in as many variables as possible.  Another consideration was that not all users were interested in the same data, so we had to find a way to show as much important data to the user as possible on a single to the user as possible, while keeping the need for them to customize to a minimum.<br><br>
I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, and would have loved to tweak and refine, and add more options to the project.  However knowing when to put the pencil down is also a skill.  Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions or just enjoy chatting about design feel free to contact me.  Design is a topic I can talk about forever and never get bored.</h3>
